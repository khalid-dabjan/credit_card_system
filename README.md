# credit_card_system

Start by cloning the repo and `cd`ing into it:

```
git clone https://github.com/khalid-dabjan/credit_card_system.git
cd credit_card_system
```

I have setup a custom script that will take care of installing both the API and the client dependencies:

```
npm run setup
```

When that's done you can start the server to view in the browser (will concurrently start both the node server and the react client):

```
npm run start
```

to run the tests:

```
npm run test
```
